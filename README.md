# BiblioGuru

> *A personal library collection and loan management system.*

## üìñ Overview

**BiblioGuru** is a cloud-based application designed to help users catalog their personal book collections and manage loans to friends, family, and other borrowers. The application tracks each book's title, author, borrower details, loan dates, and return status. By integrating AI-powered cataloging, BiblioGuru simplifies book management by allowing users to add books simply by uploading an image. The AI processes the image and identifies the book details, which are then added to the database.

The system also provides features for borrower management, ensuring you can keep track of who borrowed which books and when they're expected to return them. The UI includes an admin panel where you can manage your library with full CRUD capabilities.
